Progress:

Implementing basic features:
    Store passwords securely.
    Add new passwords.
    Retrieve existing passwords.
    Delete passwords.



Write a function to save a password.
Write a function to read all passwords. 

C++ concepts
    File I/O for storing and retrieving passwords.
    Data encryption and decryption for security.
    Classes and objects for managing passwords.
    User input and output for interaction.


add encryption

OpenSSL:
    The functionality includes symmetric encryption, public key cryptography, 
    key agreement, certificate handling, cryptographic hash functions, 
    cryptographic pseudo-random number generators, message authentication codes (MACs), 
    key derivation functions (KDFs), and various utilities.

features to add:
    alphabetize by services
    adding two-factor authentication

5/20/24:
    Using SQLite, specifically sqlite3 API 
        - serverless database (does not require a separate server -> simple deploy and manage)
        - lightweight (disk space and memory usage)
    Embedded database for local/client storage  
    Follows ACID properties (atomicity, consistency, isolation, & durability)
    Almost all OS supports it
